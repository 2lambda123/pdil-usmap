# us-map
A US map template in R including Alaska and Hawaii that can serve as a template for state and county level choropleths.

The shape files that we use to plot the maps in R are located in the `shape-files` folder. For more information refer to https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html. Map scales of varying sizes (1:500,000 to 1:20,000,000) at both the state and county levels are included for convenience.
