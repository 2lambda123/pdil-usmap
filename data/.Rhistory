magnificent mesas to the west, past the banks of the historic Rio Grande to the
Sandia Mountains to the east, Albuquerque is a blend of culture and cuisine,
styles and stories, people, pursuits and panoramas.
Offering a distinctive campus environment with a Pueblo Revival architectural
theme, the campus buildings echo nearby Pueblo Indian villages. The nationally
recognized campus arboretum and the popular duck pond offer an outstanding
botanical experience in the midst of one of New Mexico's great public open
spaces.

UNM Traditions-The Lobo Nickname
A number of legends have arisen over the years as to how The University of New
Mexico got Lobo as its official nickname. When the university began playing
football in 1892, the team was simply referred to as The University Boys or
Varsities to distinguish themselves from the prep school kids.
The student body, at least as early as 1917, began to seriously explore the
possibilities for both a mascot and a new name for the student newspaper, which
was then called simply the U.N.M. Weekly. Several names for the paper were
suggested, including The Rattler, the Sand Devil, the Ki-yo-te and the Cherry
and Silver. However, there was no single name that struck a responsive chord
among the students and when school opened in the Fall of 1920 the U.N.M. Weekly
was still there.
On Sept. 22, 1920, sophomore George S. Bryan, editor of the U.N.M. Weekly and
student manager of the football team, was present at a Student Council meeting
for the purpose of suggesting that the University teams be given a mascot name
as at that time many universities had mascot names for their teams. Bryan
suggested Lobo, the Spanish word for wolf, as the nickname. The name was
enthusiastically received. The Oct. 1 issue of the student paper said, The
Lobo is respected for his cunning, feared for his prowess, and is the leader of
the pack. It is the ideal name for the Varsity boys who go forth to battle for
the glory of the school. All together now; fifteen rahs for the LOBOS.
From that beginning, the Lobo nickname has remained with The University of New
Mexico for over 70 years.
UNM Traditions - The Lobo Mascot
After Lobo was adopted as the school's nickname in 1920, it was not long
thereafter that a real Lobo became the mascot.
Bruno Dieckmann, class of 1902, and by 1920 a successful Albuquerque insurance
and real estate agent, acquired the first Lobo for the University at his own
expense. At the time he was treasurer of the Athletic Association and one of
the most admired men in town.
Elsie Ruth Chant, class of 1923, recalled, All of the girls on campus wanted
to be seen with him. He was an accomplished concert violinist as well as being
a successful businessman, and he was rich. He drove a Stutz Bearcat convertible
around town and all of the girls would compete to get rides with him. Sometimes
he had five or six girls in the car, and when he finally got married, he left
broken hearts all over campus. Anyway, he either caught it himself or he paid
to have a wolf captured in the Mount Taylor area. The wolf was brought into the
school and a student by the name of Bowman would take it on a leash to the
football practice area.
Apparently, a government trapper named Jim Young caught a wolf pup on the Floyd
Lee Ranch near Mount Taylor in western part of the state. The cub became the
responsibility of the cheerleaders and it appeared in harness at every football
game. However, in the late 20s, a child teased the wolf and the child was
bitten at one of the games. UNM officials were forced to dispose of the wolf,
as one historian put it, for fear other ill-bred brats might become tempted to
play with the wolf and bring a damage suit.
A live wolf has really never been a part of the athletics scene since. In the
early 1960s a human mascot named Lobo Louie was created. A second mascot,
Lobo Lucy was created in the early 1980s. Both are now members of the
school's cheerleading squad.
UNM Traditions - Cherry and Silver
The most common origin of New Mexico's school colors dates back nearly 100
years. Apparently, the school colors in the early 1890s were black and gold.
Ms. Harriet Jenness, a faculty member who taught drawing, delsarte (drama),
penmanship and music, suggested a change in school colors because black and
gold did not give a true feeling of New Mexico. She suggested the crimson
evening glow of the majestic Sandia mountains to the east. The silver came from
when students and faculty took picnics in the Sandias and noted the Rio Grande
looked like a silver ribbon winding through the valley below. Her ideas were
enthusiastically adopted by the faculty and staff. The crimson was later
changed to cherry, the color of a Sandia sunset. Miss Jenness died in 1895, two
years before the colors were adopted as official. From 1973-79, turquoise was
integrated into the official school colors, at least, for the athletics teams.
The football team wore turquoise jerseys at home during those years. Cherry and
silver returned as the predominant colors in 1980.
UNM Traditions - The Alma Mater
The Alma Mater (in Latin means Nourishing or Dear Mother) was a source of
contention at UNM in 1947. The original Alma Mater was set to the tune of
Annie Lyle, which was an unpopular tune with the student body for a long
period of time. The student body voted in a general election to change the Alma
Mater and found Glee Club Director Craig Summers to oblige. Actually Mr.
Summers and his father wrote the present Alma Mater three years before and
called it The New Mexico Hymn.
New Mexico, New Mexico
We sing to honor thee.
This golden haze of college days
Will live in memory.
This praise we sing will ever ring
With truth and loyalty New Mexico, your fame we know
Will last eternally.
UNM Traditions - The Fight Song
The UNM fight Song was written in 1930. The music to the Fight Song was written
by Dean Lena Clauve, who served the University for 32 years as a professor of
music education and as the Dean of Women. Dr. George St. Clair, professor in
the English Department, wrote the lyrics.
Hail to thee, New Mexico,
Thy loyal sons are we. Marching down the field we go,
Fighting for thee.
RAH! RAH! RAH!
Now we pledge our faith to thee,
Never shall we fail.
Fighting ever, yielding never.
HAIL! HAIL! HAIL!
